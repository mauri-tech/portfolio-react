I knew that to get it right I was going to have to replicate the viewing conditions of someone from the future, so I grabbed my space helmet from the closet, created a new Figma document, and got to work.

I enrolled in a bootcamp program where I learned various coding languages and frameworks through hands-on projects. This practical experience transformed my theoretical knowledge into practical skills. The instructors provided personalized guidance, accelerating my learning and fostering my growth.

Tutors played a crucial role in helping me understand complex coding concepts. Their patient guidance and customized instruction boosted my confidence and helped me overcome challenges. Their expertise enriched my coding journey, making it easier to navigate through the intricacies of coding.

ChatGPT, an AI-powered virtual assistant, became my trusty coding companion. It provided instant solutions, explanations, and insights whenever I had questions or faced complex problems. ChatGPT's support ensured a smooth learning experience.

YouTube became a valuable resource as I explored coding tutorials created by experienced developers and enthusiasts. I absorbed their knowledge, learned new languages, and discovered innovative techniques at my own pace.

By combining the power of bootcamps, tutors, ChatGPT, and YouTube, I transformed from a coding novice to a skilled coder in just 10 months. The progress I made exceeded my expectations, fueling my passion for programming and opening doors to exciting opportunities. These experiences and resources not only shaped my skills but also boosted my confidence and resilience as a coder. I now approach the world of coding with unwavering determination, ready to explore and conquer new challenges.
