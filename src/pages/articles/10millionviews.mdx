In less than 15 days, I generated over 10 million views with the power of artificial intelligence.

As a recent addition to TikTok, I knew I had to make a splash. So, I decided to create something entirely unique using AI.

I employed a range of cutting-edge tools in the process, including Midjourney for creating the character images and letsenhance.io for upscaling all the visuals. Then, with the help of Eleven Labs and Fake You, I crafted authentic dialogue for each character.

Finally, I used d-id.com to animate the characters and give them a voice, while also ensuring that they captured the fun and engaging style that TikTok demands.

The result was a series of videos that not only grabbed attention but also encouraged people to share and engage with the content. In fact, I have never seen such a rapid and enthusiastic response to any of my previous paid work with brands.

The possibilities of AI in marketing are immense, and my success with this project is a testament to that. So, if you're looking to stand out and make a splash, let me show you what AI can do for your brand or content.
